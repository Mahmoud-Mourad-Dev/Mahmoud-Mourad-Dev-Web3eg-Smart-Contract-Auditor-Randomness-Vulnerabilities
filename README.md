# Deterministic 
## Smart contracts are deterministic  same input = same output 
- A deterministic smart contract is a contract in which the same inputs always produce the same outputs, no matter when or where the contract is executed. Determinism is crucial in smart contracts to ensure consistency, predictability, and trust across all Ethereum nodes in the network
- Consistency Across Nodes: All Ethereum nodes running the contract reach the same result when processing the same transaction. This is vital for consensus.

- This smart contract is called Games and it implements a simple game where a user can guess a "random" number.
 If their guess matches the number generated by the contract, they win the entire contract balance. 
 - A "random" number is generated using:
block.timestamp: The timestamp of the current block.
block.number: The current block number.
block.difficulty: The mining difficulty of the current block.

- These values are combined using the keccak256 hash function, and the result is converted to a uint256.
Problem
-  This approach is not secure for randomness because miners or attackers can predict or manipulate these values.

    function play(uint gues) external {
        uint256 random = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.number, block.difficulty)));
// Checking the Guess
        if (gues == random) {
            (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
            require(success, "Transfer failed.");
